				<p>The second in a series of imaginary structures, Dock Street Market is a fictional indoor/ outdoor produce stand in West Philadelphia. Outside the market, a series of canopies shade the sidewalk and streets from Philadelphia's summer sun, offering residents a place to relax on Moroccan-style couches beneath them.</p>
				<p> Dock Street Market is not the idea of a studied architect, planner, or designer. It is a representation of a local resident's desire, informed by her current experiences in Philadelphia and past experiences abroad. The rendering serves to extend the participant's ability to imagine--to give her agency over her own environment. This is an instance of architectural services provided to a 'client' valued for her intimate relationship with the site rather than her economic potential. The participant is pictured at her home.
